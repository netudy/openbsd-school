# "Relinking to create a unique kernel" 
# is a process in OpenBSD that creates a kernel binary,
# with a unique memory layout each time the system boots. 
# This enhances security by making it harder for attackers to predict
# the memory addresses of critical functions or data within the kernel.
# The process is part of OpenBSD’s approach to address space layout randomization (ASLR)
# and mitigates certain types of attacks that rely on predictable memory locations,
# like return-oriented programming (ROP) attacks.

# How It Works
# Randomization: At each boot, the kernel is relinked to randomize
# the layout of functions and objects in memory.
# This is not the same as simply loading a pre-built kernel binary—it
# modifies the kernel itself on each boot.
# System Impact: This means that each time the system starts,
# the internal structure of the kernel changes, making exploits
# that depend on fixed memory locations significantly harder.
